I created this directory.  It's for vendor libraries, but also for the section of my extension
that is to run directly under the vscode main process.  The 'src' folder is for the
official extension code that will run in its own process.

I need some code that runs directly in the vscode main process, so I can manipulatae the
DOM directly.
